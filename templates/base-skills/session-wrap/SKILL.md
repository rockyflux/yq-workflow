# Session Wrap Skill

## Overview

Use this skill to close out the **current** coding session in a way that is easy to resume later. Focus on what was actually finished, what is still open, what was learned, and what should happen next.

## Core Rules

- Scope is the **current session** unless the user explicitly asks for a broader range.
- Prioritize outcomes, decisions, learnings, and follow-up actions over process chatter.
- Do not output a chronological 流水账.
- Do not claim work is completed unless there is evidence in the session, git status, or validation output.
- If the user asks to write files, commit, or update docs, summarize first and then confirm the action.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm scope

Default to the current session. If the user already gave a clear wrap-up request, do not ask extra questions.

Clarify only when needed:
- current session only or also include earlier sessions
- whether to include commit advice
- whether to produce a handoff note or just a chat summary

### Step 2: Inspect the working tree

Collect the minimum evidence needed to summarize the session accurately.

Recommended commands:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git log --oneline -n 10
```

If the repository state is not available, say so explicitly and continue with the session evidence you do have.

### Step 3: Summarize completed work

Summarize by **workstream** instead of by timestamp.

Preferred structure:
- 本次完成
- 关键决策
- 涉及文件 / 模块
- 已做验证

If there were no meaningful code changes, say that clearly instead of inventing成果.

### Step 4: Extract learnings and open items

Capture the parts that matter for the next session:
- new findings
- mistakes avoided or lessons learned
- known risks
- unfinished tasks
- blockers or dependencies

Keep this section concise and operational.

### Step 5: Offer next actions and commit guidance

When relevant, finish with:
- suggested next steps
- whether a commit is appropriate now
- a possible commit message direction
- whether additional verification is still needed

Do not auto-commit. Recommend commit timing only when there is enough evidence.

## Recommended Output Shape

```markdown
## 本次会话总结

### 已完成
- ...

### 关键决策
- ...

### 涉及文件 / 模块
- ...

### 验证情况
- 已验证：...
- 未验证：...

### 经验与风险
- ...

### 下一步建议

```

## When to Use

- 用户说“总结会话”
- 用户说“收尾”或“会话收尾”
- 当前会话已经完成一段明确工作，需要压缩成可复用总结
- 需要为下一次继续工作准备 handoff

## When Not to Use

- 用户要的是“今天所有会话”的汇总，而不是当前会话
- 用户要的是纯 commit 日报
- 当前会话几乎没有实际工作内容，只是简单问答

In those cases, prefer a daily summary or research-note style skill instead.

## Quality Checklist

Before responding, verify:

- [ ] Summary is scoped to the current session unless user asked otherwise
- [ ] Completed work is grouped by workstream, not by timeline
- [ ] Validation is reported honestly
- [ ] Risks and unfinished items are explicit
- [ ] No fake completion, fake commit readiness, or fake verification claims
